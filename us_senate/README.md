### Code for scraping and analysing US senate election polls

This folder provides resources for analysing the association between contextual factors and poll accuracy in US Senate elections.

The [scrape](https://github.com/SinaMaria412/predictors_of_polling_errors/tree/master/us_senate/scrape) folder contains code for scraping US senate polls from 1998 to 2018 from pollingreport.us.
In the [covariates](https://github.com/SinaMaria412/predictors_of_polling_errors/tree/master/us_senate/covariates) folder you can find code for classifying the gender and race of US Senate candidates based on photographs as well as candidate names. Additional code on merging this information as well as further covariates to the scraped Senate election polls can be found in this folder.
Code for a hierarchical Bayesian analysis of potential predictors of polling errors can be found in the [analysis](https://github.com/SinaMaria412/predictors_of_polling_errors/tree/master/us_senate/analysis) folder.
